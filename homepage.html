          Hello and welcome to how to be a snorp. Sorry, I'm just gonna type a bunch of random things
          until I fill this whole entire thing up. You know what<br>
          I wish this old chromebook had? Access to sublime and
          things you'd find available on a pc. But, the thing is, this isn't a pc. It's technically
          a tablet<br> with a keyboard and it's extremely slow. Maybe it's the asus part of it. I don't know.<br>
        </p>
        <p>But, anyway, flowers are pretty</p>
