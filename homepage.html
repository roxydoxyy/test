            Hello and welcome to how to be a snorp. Sorry, I'm just gonna type a bunch of random things
            until I fill this whole entire thing up. You know what<br>
            I wish this old chromebook had? Access to sublime and
            things you'd find available on a pc. But, the thing is, this isn't a pc. It's technically
            a tablet<br> with a keyboard and it's extremely slow. Maybe it's the asus part of it. I don't know.<br>
          </p>
          <p>But, anyway, flowers are pretty</p>
